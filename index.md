You should already have a basic understanding of computer graphics and related concepts to understand these tutorials.
You can find a great introduction [here](https://cglearn.eu/pub/computer-graphics).

### C++ API Reference

The automatically generated API documentations of the C++ libraries that PADrend uses.

### EScript API Reference

The automatically generated API documentations of the EScript libraries that PADrend uses.
This only contains the API coming form the c++ "E_"-Libraries.
PADrend extends these libraries using its plugin system which is currently not documented.
Therefore, some available functions might be missing from the API reference.
